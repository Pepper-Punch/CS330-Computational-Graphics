# CS330-Computational-Graphics
Portfolio submission for SNHU CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization
### Derek Castro

This entry includes my 3D Scene project and Design Decisions document. These documents help portray my ability to create a sufficient 3D environment while understanding how design and development work together.

---

### How do I approach designing software?
I start by planning ahead using pseudocode and testing one part of a project at a time. This project helped me learn how lighting, textures, and shapes affect the final scene.

### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I improved at adjusting visuals for realism and using smaller changes to reach a better design.

### What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed a step-by-step process from modeling to lighting, testing after each milestone.

### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Breaking big tasks into smaller ones and testing early will help in future coding and design projects.

### How do I approach developing programs?
I build slowly, test often, and fix errors before moving forward. Each milestone built on the last.

### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I learned to reuse code, manage objects better, and adjust parameters for lighting and textures.

### How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration helped me make steady progress and fix visual or logic issues right away.

### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
Buildng upon pre-existing code with reliable resource examples has helped progress my completion of projects. 

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science helps me understand logic better while maintaining familiarity with modern strategies. 

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
They gave me practical experience using 3D concepts that will help in future higher-level courses or career projects.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
It showed me how graphics programming can connect to real-world applications like games, design, or visualization tools.
